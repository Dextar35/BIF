    "Molecular docking is a computational technique used in drug discovery to predict how a small molecule (ligand) interacts with a target protein. It simulates the binding process and determines the correct orientation and position of the ligand inside the protein’s active site. The main goal of docking is to estimate the binding affinity and identify the most stable binding pose based on scoring functions. A better (more negative) binding score indicates stronger interaction and greater potential for drug effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein–ligand binding mainly involves non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic contacts, electrostatic attractions, and van der Waals forces. Docking algorithms explore these interactions and generate several possible conformations. The best pose is selected based on the lowest energy state, meaning that the ligand fits well in the binding pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual screening is an extension of docking where large libraries of chemical compounds are screened against the target protein to identify potential lead molecules. Instead of testing one ligand, thousands can be tested computationally. This method significantly reduces the cost and time required in early drug discovery compared to traditional laboratory trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a typical drug development workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "The target protein is selected and prepared by removing bound ligands and water molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ligands are optimized and converted into suitable formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docking and screening simulations are performed using software such as PyRx, which utilizes AutoDock Vina scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best-scoring molecules are further analyzed using visualization tools like PyMOL to study their interactions and important binding residues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, molecular docking and virtual screening play a crucial role in modern computer-aided drug design (CADD). They help identify strong binding molecules early in the research pipeline, guiding experimental validation and accelerating drug discovery."
